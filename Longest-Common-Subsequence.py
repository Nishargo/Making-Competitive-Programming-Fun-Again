# A longest common subsequence (LCS) is the longest subsequence that is common in all given input sequences. 
# In a given set of sequences, the goal is to find a common subsequence of all the sequences of maximal length.
# Example: "ace" is a subsequence of "abcdef".
# We will use recursion to solve the problem.
# At first, we will create a recursive function.
# Then we will decide on the conditions based on the first characters of the strings.
# Depending on the conditions, we will run the next recursive function.
