# Intro
Competitive Programming is a fun way to test your intuitive knowledge about the algorithms you have learned and practiced. 
It does not matter if you are a beginner or an expert, if you would like to make your intuition stronger, you must practice.

A list that we will go through to refresh our knowledge: 

1. Dynamic programming
2. Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)
3. Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort)
4. Greedy algorithms
5. Backtracking
6. Graph algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm)
7. Data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps)

I have also included commonly used functions in terms of CP.

The list might be edited, modified, or merged.
