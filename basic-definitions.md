Algorithm: An algorithm is a step by step process to solve a problem. These steps are specifically directions that describe how to do something, and the computer is then able to perform that. An algorithm is conducted by following a method that is made up of inputs. These inputs lead to a result known as outputs. 

Data Structure: Data structures are a means of organizing, processing, storing, and retrieving information effectively. Common examples are arrays, linked lists, trees etc.

Database: Database is an organized collection of data. It is usually stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Databases are managed by database management systems (DBMS).

Variable: Variable is a storage location that is identified by a memory address. It is associated with a name that contains a known or unknown quantity of information, referred to as a value. A variable is said to be unknown when its value has not yet been determined, assigned, or initialized.

Code: Instructions that are written in any kind of programming language that a computer can execute.

Loop: A sequence of instructions that is repeated continuously until it meets a certain condition.

Debugging: The process of identifying, analyzing, and removing bugs from a given code is known as debugging.

Time complexity: Time complexity is a kind of computational complexity that tells us the time required to execute an algorithm. It focuses on the running time of it. The amount of time taken for each statement to complete is equal to the time complexity of an algorithm.

Space Complexity: Space complexity refers to the total space that is taken up by an algorithm in terms of the input size. 

Space complexity = Auxiliary space + Input space.

Auxiliary space = the extra or temporary space that an algorithm uses.
