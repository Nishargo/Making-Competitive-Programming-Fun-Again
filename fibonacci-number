# The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers that has a pattern where the next number can be found by summing the two numbers before it.
Hee's an example:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,...

In the sequence above, We got 2 by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
Then we got 3 by summing the two numbers before it (1+2),
We got 5 by adding 2+3
It goes on...

An exercise for you: find how we got 55 in the sequence?

   
Function to find nth Fibonacci Number
We are going to consider 0 and 1 as the first two Fibonacci numbers

def fibonacci(n):
    x = 0
    y = 1
    if n < 0:
        print("Incorrect input. Please insert a positive number.")
    elif n == 0:
        return x
    elif n == 1:
        return y
    else:
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            z = x + y
            x = y
            y = z
        return y
  
print(fibonacci(5))
